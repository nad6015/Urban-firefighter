## Elevator Pitch
A hero, a savior, a firefighter rushing to save as many people and animals from buildings on fire in a huge city somewhere in the world. 

## Summary

Buildings catching fire, a lot of people, animals and property in danger but only our hero can save them. The player will take the role of a fearless firefighter taking risky decisions to save as many lives as possible from buildings on fire. With limited time and gear our player will need to prioritize the right tools to advance through the levels and bring people to safety. 

## Unique Selling Points (USPs)
In this action platformer the player will interact, act and respond with the following game mechanics;

Unlike most survivor games, this one focuses on interacting with the scenario and levels to solve puzzles and save NPCs.  
The player will take turns with the game mechanics to continue advancing through the game and manage its limited resources (i.e water to extinguish the fire) to finish each level.  
The player will use some elements of the environment to extinguish the flames, save people or advance to the next level.

## Key Mechanics
In this game project, we'll use the core elements of a 2D Platformer game, where the player will start each level as if it was a building floor, and to complete each level the player will have to clear the challenges from left to right or until it finds the stairway to the next building floor. 

## Core elements and mechanics;

- Upgrades and power-ups: Improve the firefighter toolkit and get stronger as the player makes progress. Collectables will be spread out through the levels so the player can get stronger tools to advance. 
- Save people and animals: The player will have to continue saving lives as each level progresses, by doing so the player will have to decide where to focus. Should the player save lives first? or extinguish the fire to avoid a worst scenario in the future?
- Extinguish the flames:  This will be a PvE (Player versus Environment) type of mechanic. The player will need to contain damages as fast as possible or the building will collapse and the game will be over. 
- Levels and Progression: At the end of every level the player must find the starway door to complete the current level. This is the only condition that will allow the player to go to the next scenario, however if the player doesn't complete the side quests points will be deducted at the overall game score.
